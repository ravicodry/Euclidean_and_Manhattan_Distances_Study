# Euclidean_and_Manhattan_Distances_Study
While working on this quick case study, you'll see examples and comparisons of distance measures. Specifically, you'll visually compare the Euclidean distance to the Manhattan distance measures. Distance measures have a multitude of uses in data science and are the foundations of many algorithms you'll be using, including Prinical Components Analysis.
